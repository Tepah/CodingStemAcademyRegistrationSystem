How to run the server app (python):

In one terminal…
cd Server
python -m venv venv		| create the virtual environment (makes a new folder)

For Apple users:
source venv/bin/activate	| starts the virtual environment
For Windows users:
./venv/Scripts/activate
(Use exit to stop running venv when you’re done.)

Make sure python libraries are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

(Need to have Python 3.12)
Running it:
python run.py

If there’s an error about running scripts, open Powershell in Administrator and run.
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
If there’s any libraries missing, use pip install <insert library name here>

MySQL Server 
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
Get MySQL Installer 8.0.42
Get MySQL Server 8.0.42 and MySQL Workbench 8.0.42
Install both of these.
Type and Networking: Development Computer

In MySQL Workbench, open the instance that was created by MySQL Server.
File -> Open Scripts -> backup.sql
Run the script.
The default schema is “sys”. That’s the Database name. Double click it in the Schemas tab to set it as default.
In db_connection.py, make sure all of the information is set up correctly.

If the MySQL server doesn’t start up, go to Task Manager->Services and start MySQL80.

Now run the server and client app.

Solution: Removing `"type": "commonjs"`, from `package.json` from app folder.
